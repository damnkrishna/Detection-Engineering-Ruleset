# 2796ca36-ebb5-4b99-867d-88bfca247223 — golden replay datasets

`Point-of-Sale RAM Scraper Process Creation (AN1361-A)`

Generated from the live rule on `siem.correlation.rules`. Every event is derived
from this rule's own IR — conditions, aggregate threshold, window and stage
timings — and every dataset was replayed through the production deserializer and
the production-parity rule dispatcher before being written. See `proof.md`.

## Technique Breakdown

* What it is: Financial Theft. Adversaries target retail endpoints, Point of Sale (POS) terminals, or billing servers to tamper with database transaction tables, modify accounting settings, or scrape credit card data from RAM, resulting in financial loss.
* Log Source Requirements: Sysmon Process Creation events (Event ID 1) / Security Event ID 4688, and Sysmon File Creation/Modification events (Event ID 11).
* Coverage Check:
  - HIDS (Sysmon + Windows Defender): YES. Scraping tools and database file writes are tracked.
  - NIDS (Suricata + Zeek): NO. Host-local application manipulation.
* Log Sources Covered:
  - Sysmon Event ID 1 (process_creation)
  - Sysmon Event ID 11 (file_event)
* Log Sources Missing / Unused:
  - None.

## Blind Spots & Tuning (The "Problems")

- Authorized IT administration activities.
- Tune with allowlists for known trusted execution paths.

## Files

| File | Expected alerts | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `true_positive_1.jsonl` | 1 | THRESHOLD: stage 0 × 1 event(s) |
| `true_positive_2.jsonl` | 1 | THRESHOLD: stage 0 × 1 event(s) |
| `benign_1.jsonl` | 0 | near-miss value for 'parent_image not_regex .*\Q\setup.exe\E$' — every other condition holds, so the stage gate rejects the events |
| `benign_2.jsonl` | 0 | near-miss value for 'cmd_line contains pos-scrape' — every other condition holds, so the stage gate rejects the events |

## Replaying

These datasets must be replayed onto **`replay-events-sysmon`**.
The topic name is not cosmetic: `NormalizedEventDeserializer` selects its parser
from the topic, and `inferSourceFromTopic` derives `NormalizedEvent.source` — the
value `rule.isApplicableTo` gates on. Replayed onto a topic that resolves to a
different source, this rule cannot fire at all.

```
replay --file true_positive_1.jsonl --topic replay-events-sysmon
```

## Determinism

Timestamps anchor at a fixed origin (`2026-03-02T09:00:00.000Z`), identities derive from the rule id, and event uids are content-derived.
Regenerating from an unchanged rule reproduces these files byte for byte.
