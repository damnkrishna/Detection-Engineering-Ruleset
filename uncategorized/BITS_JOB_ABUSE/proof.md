## Stage requirements

### Stage 0

- Aggregate: `count`, threshold 1.0
- Events required: 1

**Conditions the generator committed to**

| Field | Condition | Derived value |
|---|---|---|
| `signature_name` | signature_name contains bitsadmin /transfer | `Windows audit failure event bitsadmin /transfer` |

### Stage 1

- Aggregate: `count`, threshold 1.0
- `within_seconds` = 3600 (deadline for the next stage)
- Events required: 1

**Conditions the generator committed to**

| Field | Condition | Derived value |
|---|---|---|
| `tactic` | tactic in_list [TA0002, TA0003] | `TA0003` |

## true_positive_1

**Expected alerts:** 1  
**Construction:** SEQUENCE: stage 0 × 1 event(s) → stage 1 × 1 event(s)

### Evidence table

| # | Event time | Stage | Key fields | Why this event exists |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-03-02T09:00:00.000Z | 0 | `signature_name`=Windows audit failure event bitsadmin /transfer<br>`hostname`=HR-WKS-506<br>`agent_ip`=10.42.97.157<br>`severity_id`=3<br>… | satisfies every condition of stage 0; increments the count aggregate to 1/1 — the threshold event that completes stage 0; starts the stage-1 deadline timer at +3600s (rule window) |
| 2 | 2026-03-02T09:05:00.000Z | 1 | `tactic`=TA0003<br>`hostname`=HR-WKS-506<br>`agent_ip`=10.42.97.157<br>`severity_id`=3<br>… | satisfies every condition of stage 1; increments the count aggregate to 1/1 — the threshold event that completes stage 1 |

### What the engine actually did

Replayed through `NormalizedEventDeserializer` on `replay-events-hids` and `MultiLaneRuleEvaluator`:

- events ingested: 2 of 2 lines (0 dead-lettered)
- raw interpreter alerts: 1
- production-comparable incidents: 1 (expected 1)
- resolved `source` = `wazuh`, lane key = `10.42.97.157`
- alert `70d6323a21232b8f382cbad5c91795fc` on lane `entity_key` = `10.42.97.157`, match mode `SEQUENCE`, 2 matched event(s)

## true_positive_2

**Expected alerts:** 1  
**Construction:** SEQUENCE: stage 0 × 1 event(s) → stage 1 × 1 event(s)

### Evidence table

## benign_1

**Expected alerts:** 0  
**Construction:** stage order inverted — the final stage's events precede the stage-0 completion, so IrSequenceEvaluator never advances past stage 0

### Evidence table

| # | Event time | Stage | Key fields | Why this event exists |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-03-02T09:00:00.000Z | 1 | `tactic`=TA0003<br>`hostname`=HR-WKS-506<br>`agent_ip`=10.42.97.157<br>`severity_id`=3<br>… | arrives before stage 0 has completed; IrSequenceEvaluator only evaluates state.currentStage (0), so a final-stage event at this point is ignored |
| 2 | 2026-03-02T09:00:01.000Z | 0 | `signature_name`=Windows audit failure event bitsadmin /transfer<br>`hostname`=HR-WKS-506<br>`agent_ip`=10.42.97.157<br>`severity_id`=3<br>… | completes stage 0, but the stage-1 evidence has already passed and is never replayed |

### What the engine actually did

Replayed through `NormalizedEventDeserializer` on `replay-events-hids` and `MultiLaneRuleEvaluator`:

- events ingested: 2 of 2 lines (0 dead-lettered)
- raw interpreter alerts: 0
- production-comparable incidents: 0 (expected 0)
- resolved `source` = `wazuh`, lane key = `10.42.97.157`

## benign_2

**Expected alerts:** 0  
**Construction:** inter-stage gap exceeds the window the rule allows, so the stage transition is rejected and the partial match is discarded

### Evidence table

| # | Event time | Stage | Key fields | Why this event exists |

| 2 | 2026-03-02T09:16:00.000Z | 1 | `tactic`=TA0003<br>`hostname`=HR-WKS-506<br>`agent_ip`=10.42.97.157<br>`severity_id`=3<br>… | arrives 960s after the previous stage completed, past the 600s inter-stage bound, so the evaluator resets the partial match |
